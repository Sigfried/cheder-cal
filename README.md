## Plans
We will be: 
 - learning about the Hebrew calendar,
 - learning about programming and software development
 - writing software to convert between Hebrew and Gregorian
 - making the project meaningful for each of us in some way
 - documenting and sharing our progress
 - maybe submitting papers or posters to academic venues (Jewish education perhaps?) or science fairs
