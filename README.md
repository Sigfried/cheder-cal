# cheder-cal

## Plans
We will be: 
 - learning about the Hebrew calendar,
 - learning about programming and software development
 - writing software to convert between Hebrew and Gregorian
 - making the project meaningful for each of us in some way
 - documenting and sharing our progress
 - maybe submitting papers or posters to academic venues (Jewish education perhaps?) or science fairs
 

### Resources
[Hebrew Calendar Quick Reference](files/quickref.pdf)

[Calendar Texts](files/calendarTexts.pdf)

### Class notes

#### Week 1, 17 Sep 2017, Intro
 - Introductions (until repo is private, participants are: SSG, MFB, DF, JM, LS, SMG)
 - How can we make this meaningful to ourselves?
   - learn programming and software development
   - learn about Judaism and calendars
   - teacher younger kids about Hebrew calendar
   - integrate somehow with Bar Mitzvah drash and project
   - interesting science questions about calendars and annual cycles

#### Week 2, 24 Sep 2017, Tools and Goals
 - Overview
 
   It's hard to set goals without some idea of:
     - Why you're doing what you're doing, and
     - What resources you have to do it with
   We tried to address the *why* last week. We may have to leave that unresolved for now.
   This week we'll think about the tools we could use and what we could do with them.
   We'll try to select tools (languages, etc.) this week, try to set some basic goals,
   and, if we have time, start figuring out how we will help everyone begin doing 
   actual work.
 - Tool choices
   - Python
     - Pros:
       - Language taught in schools, will be relevant
       - Good, well-structured language
       - Don't have to learn a lot of other stuff to use it
     - Cons:
       - Can only make command-line programs (unless wanting to learn a lot of other stuff)
       - Not usable with PencilCode (if that matters)
        - Reasonable goals if using Python:
       - ...
   - JavaScript
     - Pros:
       - Can use simply for command line like Python
       - Is most widely used language in world
       - Can also make user interfaces and write programs with immediate browser feedback
         (Then have to also learn something about HTML, CSS, (React?), etc.)
     - Cons:
       - Messier than python
     - Reasonable goals if using JavaScript:
       - ...
   - Other?
  - Goals
